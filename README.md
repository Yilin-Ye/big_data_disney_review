# big_data_disney_review


## Goal

This project explores all possible relationships in the Disneyland review dataset from various aspects of exploratory data analysis and data visualization, text classification, and sentiment analysis. In this project, we performed preliminary data cleaning and visualization via Pandas and other regular python packages; in addition to that, we built a pipeline via Pyspark and implemented TF-IDF on tokenized reviews to find the association between reviewers' rating scores and their reviews via logistic regression. Finally, we use sentiment analysis to extract their review attitudes from the reviews and explore the relationship between the reviewers' ratings and the true attitudes behind their reviews, which adds a touch of humanity beyond the regression model.
